      <h3>Pyramids</h3>
      <p>This system can be applied to many concepts. To start have swimmers swim one length at full speed. Then swim 2 lengths at full speed and continue with increments up to a number capable by swimmer level. Then swimmer will swim back down and decrease the number of length until they reach back to one. The increments and maximum number don't have to be the same everytime. Try increaments of two. This can also be applied to breathing every 1 / 3 / 5 strokes in increaments.</p>

      <h3>Combination</h3>
      <p>Each swimmer should have a kickboard and pull buoy. To start place the pull buoy at the opposite end of the pool. Start with kicking with choice of kick for 25 meters. Then switch the kickboard for the pull buoy and do 25 meters of arm only swim. Third, do arms and kicks combined. Repeat this up to swimmer capability.</p>
