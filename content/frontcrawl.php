      <h3>High Elbow</h3>
      <p>A good front crawl will have elbows higher than rest of the arm during each recovery phase. A good way to picture this is to have your shoulder, elbow and hand as 3 points of a triangle. The bottom two corners of the triangle touching the water should be your shoulder and your hand while the elbow rests high above the water. Here's a list of variations of high elbow drill.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zipper Drill</li>
        <li>Chicken Swim</li>
        <li>Shark Drill</li>
        <li>Tap Head Drill</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To practice high elbows it is sometimes beneficial to pause when the elbow is at it's highest point to emphasize high elbows.</p>

      <h3>Front Glide & Side Glide</h3>
      <p>Many times students go straight to front crawl and do not build strong fundamentals. Front glide and side glide combination swim is one of the most important basics to a good front crawl. TO practic: Start with two hands holding the end of a kick board and student swimming front glide. When the student needs to breath, roll onto his or her side and hold the kick board with one arm and perform a side glide. Once the student has taken a breath return to front glide position with 2 hands on kick board. Repeat this drill until student is strong enough to hold side glide without a kick board.</p>
